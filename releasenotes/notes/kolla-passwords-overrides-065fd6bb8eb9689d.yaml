fixes:
  - |
    Fixes an issue when user forgot to combine
    ``kolla_ansible_custom_passwords``,
    ``kolla_ansible_default_custom_passwords`` and own dictionary with custom
    passwords in configuration files. Now ``kolla_ansible_custom_passwords``
    should provide only user custom passwords to add or override in the
    passwords.yml.
upgrade:

    Preferred but not required to change old configuration which contain an
    Ansible ``combine`` statement in the user configuration. The old
    configuration should work as expected.

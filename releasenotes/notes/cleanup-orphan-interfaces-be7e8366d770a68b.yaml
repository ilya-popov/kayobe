    By default ``admin_oc_net_name`` is the same as ``provision_oc_net_name``
    network used to provision bare metal overcloud hosts. But in production
    environments, there is a good idea to separate these networks using VLANs.
    Doing this is simply realized in the Kayobe, but leads to unpredictable
    results depending on Linux OS used. On the RedHat family with
    network-scripts (CentOS Linux for example), we have the orphan
    ifcfg-interface.vlanid file in the network-scripts directory which creates
    the duplicate route after the first reboot of the host. On the Debian
    family with systemd-networkd (Ubuntu Linux for example), we already have
    the orphan interface with a duplicate route right after `host configure`
    tasks are finished. The workaround for this is a manually remove the orphan
    configuration file or interface itself and/or reboot the affected hosts, or
    set the variable ``orphan_interfaces_cleanup`` to ``true``.

    Adds the ``orphan_interfaces_cleanup`` variable (by default set to ``false``)
    which is used to cleanup orphan interfaces in the system when set to
    ``true``. Also adds the variable ``orphan_interfaces_exclude`` with the default
    list of the interfaces excluded in cleanup because they have the IP address
    configured outside the Kayobe configuration, this is Loopback and
    interfaces used by the Docker and Libvirt services.
